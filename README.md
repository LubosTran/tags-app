# My take on the assignment

I tackled this assignment on the following tech stacks: Typescript, React, React Hooks, React Context, Styled Components and Ant Design.

I chose Typescript because I think it would cover both case for my experience with Ts and Js
I initially try to solve the main logic including adding removing tags by using React Hooks within the App.ts file. After making sure everything works well and since I have 10 days to complete the task, I want to put some more efforts to show other technique that I can work with. Thus I introduced React Context to the project, customized Ant Design and codes encapsulation, thinking about the project as a larger application.

Overall I had fun working on the assignment, I could spend more time on it coming up with some design, trying to use useReducer or adding webpack, eslint, test, etc. However I'm now near the end of my job hunting and would like to speed up the process, I decided to send it in the current form.

Thank you for the time and look forward to hearing from you soon.
